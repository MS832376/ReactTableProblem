# ReactTableProblem

This is some code I wrote for a ReactJS problem a potential internship provided me with. Unfortunately with Covid spiking as I was interviewing, the offer was no longer available as the company could not afford another position with the economic downturn.
Just another one added to the pile of "stuff covid ruined."

The purpose of the project was to create a table using data that was gathered from a json package.

Created in codesandbox.io environment, the end product is a sorted list of earthquakes with the ability to enter keywords for precision searching. Each row is also semi-expandable for additional information on each earthquake.
